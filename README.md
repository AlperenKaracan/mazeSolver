<p id="description">Maze solver that finds the shortest path.</p>

  
  
<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Dynamic Maze Creation: Mazes are generated with random obstacles and the layout can be reset to present new challenges.
*   Visualization of Robot Movement: The robot's path through the maze is visualized in real time showing each decision point and move.
*   Shortest Path Calculation: Implements a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination.
*   Interactive GUI: Users can interact with the application to change maze settings restart the simulation or display the shortest path after completion.
